## Revision history

### v.NEXT

* Jobs that are ready-to-run go straight from `waiting` to `ready` without waiting for a promote cycle to come around.
* Don't check for `after` and `retries` in `getWork()`

### v.0.0.16

* Updated to use the latest version of the `meteor-job` npm package

### v.0.0.15

* Added `until` option for `job.repeat()`, `job.retry()`, job.restart() and job.rerun().
* Added `jc.foreverDate` to indicate a Date that will never come
* Fixed bug where `jc.forever` was not available
* Default Date for `job.after()` is now based on the server clock, not the clock of the machine creating the job. (thanks @daeq)
* Added `created` field to job document model to keep track of when a job was first created on the server

### v.0.0.14

* Added `idGeneration` and `noCollectionSuffix` options to JobCollection constructor. Thanks to @mitar for suggestions.

### v0.0.10

### v0.0.7

* Bumped meteor-job version to 0.0.9, fixing several bugs in Meteor.server and Meteor.client workers handling.
* Corrected validation of jobDocuments for non-negative integer attributes (integer enforcement was missing).
